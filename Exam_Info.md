The exam will be *fully open*.
That means you **may use all available online and offline resources**.

However if you spend a lot of time searching for answers online, you may not have time to complete the exam.

The exam contains two parts.

* Part 1 contains mainly multiple choice questions.<br>
  Answers should be given using the available forms.<br>
  The scoring of multiple choice questions is as follows

  * The correct solution is 2 points<br>
     Wrong answer is -1 point

* Part 2 contains several programming questions related to example applications.<br>
  Starter files for all exercises are provided as a zip archive.<br>
  Download the starter files and use your IDE to solve the exercises.

  * The starter files for programming exercises include 
    * a jQuery application (but you can use pure JS in your code)
    * a javaScript application
    * a larger Flask application (similar to the trial exam)
  * The applications are **similar to solutions for exercises or assignments** from the course.

**Make sure you have python3, flask and a usefull IDE ready and you can create zip files of your coding.**
